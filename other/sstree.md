<h3 align="center">SS-Tree</h3>

`SS-Tree` or **Similarity Search Tree** is a dynamic structure for similarity indexing.
> The goal of similarity indexing is to facilitate efficient similarity queries of a dataset
typically [high dimensional feature vectors](https://mathinsight.org/vectors_arbitrary_dimensions).
**Similarity Queries** are queries that are related to some measure of similarity between
feature vector.

> The primary goal of similarity indexing is the same as the other indexing methods: to minimize 
average and worst case tiume required for query operations.
